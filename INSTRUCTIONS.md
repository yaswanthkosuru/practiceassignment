Good.

You are now on the shortlist so here comes the SOW:

The purpose of the SOW is to show that you have the skills to do the job (FE, BE, and deploying to a VM) and will not be used by us.

If you manage to do the SOW good (and are nice), you are almost guaranteed a position.

Whilst we don’t pay for the SOW, as a bonus, if you start working for us - after having worked for us at least 30 days - we will pay you €50 in bonus, so in reality you then get paid to do the SOW, even though the SOW itself has no value for us 😊

The task to do is a small mini app.

It shall contain a login, terms, and a very simple pricelist.

1. Login:
   The UI shall look and function as this URL:
   https://online.123fakturera.se/login/

The texts (English + Swedish) should be pulled from a PGSQL db that you design.

Hamburger menu should work.

For the background image and the logo and the flag, you can link to its storage in the existing solution:

https://storage.123fakturera.se/public/wallpapers/sverige43.jpg
https://storage.123fakturera.se/public/icons/diamond.png

This URL shall work on both mobile portrait, landscape, tablet and desktop resolutions.

User registration is not needed, but you can create user and password manually.

Authentication shall work, and after login, the user shall be taken to pricelist.
For authentication, you shall use JWT token based authentication.
After login all endpoints in pricelist must use this token for authentication purposes.

Links are dummies.

2. Terms:
   The UI shall look and function as this URL:
   https://online.123fakturera.se/terms/

This URL only needs to work on mobile portrait resolution.

The texts (English + Swedish) should be pulled from a PGSQL db that you design.

3. Pricelist:

It should look as in the pictures.

Here we will ignore almost all functionality, like adding products, deleting.

The design only shows one product line, but please add at least 20 so we can test the scrolling functionality.

The headers should be the same as we use, but feel free to use your own icons.

The data should be pulled from a PGSQL db that you design.

The fields like Product/Service, In Price, Price and so on should be populated with data pulled from backend.

The fields should not be locked – so we should be able to enter test data into them that should save to the db.

This URL shall work on both mobile portrait, landscape, tablet and desktop resolutions.

Tablet, landscape and portrait will not show the same fields as desktop.

(Hamburger menu does not need to work for this URL.)

Framework:
Frontend shall be developed in vite.js (or in React.js alone.) Next.js shall not be used.

Styling shall be plain (vanilla) css.

Backend shall be done in python or node.js

Language shall be js. (Not ts.)

AI:

AI can only help to develop a medium to low quality app.

However for a top quality app like ours, AI is of no help.

We have previously taken in AI dependent devs to work for us and they have had to give up, wasting both our and their time.

As such AI, (including inline AI), can under no circumstance be used for any code in the SOW as the whole point is to show if you are skilled enough to work with our real app.

(But we don't ban using it as a search engine.)

We always detect if AI is used and if we detect AI usage you will automatically be disqualified.

Deployment:
Your mini app shall be published on a Linux VM.
(There are a number of providers, where you can use a VM for free for a short time.)

If you are not able to get hold of a free VM, as a first step, you can publish the app on one of the free providers, like render.
(Then, after showing it to us we might help you with a VM.)

The code shall be updated daily on for example gitlab for us to look at.
We need you to send us the link to the code when you have started.

When you are finished so we can test it please provide a detailed list of what you have used detailing all things, like which React version, version of js, css, libraries and so on, together with the deployed links, and username and password to log in to the mini app.

As said, if you manage to do the SOW good, and are nice, you are almost guaranteed a position.

Please confirm if you are going to do the SOW or if I should remove you from my shortlist.

Please also confirm that you have understood that AI cannot be used for any code.

Any questions?

Kind Regards
Emanuel
